Week1

As a small assignment given, I partially studied a language totally new to me, named Wolfram. Along with other types, the language also supports functional programming. The language is very rich in functions.
We were introduced to GitHub, something which should have happened in the 1st semester. We, then, signed-in and tried to see how it works.
As part of 1st assignment, we started trying to study the respective research papers assigned to us. Now we are writing a review on it...still working.
